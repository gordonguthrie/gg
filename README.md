# GG

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If it was [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package could be installed
by adding `gg` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs` as per normal, but it isn't, so...

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:gg, git: "https://github.com/gordonguthrie/gg.git"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/gg](https://hexdocs.pm/gg).
